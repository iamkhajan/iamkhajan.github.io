As a Solution Architect, my job is to filter noise. Here is my Q1 2026 Tech Radar—technologies I am actively implementing for revenue-critical systems.

Let's first look into the 4 pillars of the Radar:

- **Hold**
- **Assess**
- **Trial**
- **Adopt**

For simplification i will refer Assess and Trial to Eval

### 🟢 Adopt: Multi-Agent Orchestration
Standard RAG is becoming a commodity. If you have not explored just try NotebookLM .The real value is now in **Agentic Workflows** where LLMs have tool-use capabilities to self-correct data retrieval. I wont be surprised if there is compnay out there building just "tools"

### 🟡 Eval: Small Language Models (SLMs)
Models like Phi-4 or Llama-3-Tiny are proving that "smaller is faster" for specific task-oriented logic. If you are trying to solve just one domain use case , do you really need a ferrari ? 

### 🔴 Hold: Traditional Chatbots
If your AI strategy is just a wrapper around a prompt, you are building technical debt. The shift is toward **context-aware ecosystems.**
