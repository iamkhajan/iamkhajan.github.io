Here is my Q1 2026 Tech Radar—technologies I am actively implementing for revenue-critical systems.\n\nLet's first look into the 4 pillars of the Radar:\n\n- **Hold**\n- **Assess**\n- **Trial**\n- **Adopt**\n\nFor simplification i will refer Assess and Trial to Eval\n\n### 🟢 Adopt: Multi-Agent Orchestration\nStandard RAG is becoming a commodity. If you have not explored just try NotebookLM .The real value is now in **Agentic Workflows** where LLMs have tool-use capabilities to self-correct data retrieval. I wont be surprised if there is compnay out there building just \"tools\"\n\n### 🟡 Eval: Small Language Models (SLMs)\nModels like Phi-4 or Llama-3-Tiny are proving that \"smaller is faster\" for specific task-oriented logic. If you are trying to solve just one domain use case , do you really need a ferrari ? \n\n### 🔴 Hold: Traditional Chatbots\nIf your AI strategy is just a wrapper around a prompt, you are building technical debt. The shift is toward **context-aware ecosystems.**"}]}}
